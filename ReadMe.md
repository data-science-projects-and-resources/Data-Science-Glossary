- ## A
**Algorithm**:  A series of repeatable steps for carrying out a certain type of task with data. As with data structures, people studying computer science learn about different algorithms and their suitability for various tasks. Specific data structures often play a role in how certain algorithms get implemented. See also data structure Wikipedia entry

**Analytical skills**:  Qualities and characteristics associated with using facts to solve problems

**Analytical thinking**:  The process of identifying and defining a problem, then solving it by using data in an organized, step-by-step manner

**AngularJS**:  An open-source JavaScript library maintained by Google and the AngularJS community that lets developers create what are known as Single [web] Page Applications. AngularJS is popular with data scientists as a way to show the results of their analysis. See also JavaScript, D3 Wikipedia entry

**Artificial Intelligence**:  Also, AI. The ability to have machines act with apparent intelligence, although varying definitions of “intelligence” lead to a range of meanings for the artificial variety. In AI’s early days in the 1960s, researchers sought general principles of intelligence to implement, often using symbolic logic to automate reasoning. As the cost of computing resources dropped, the focus moved more toward statistical analysis of large amounts of data to drive decision making that gives the appearance of intelligence. See also machine learning, data mining Wikipedia entry

- ## B
**Backpropogation**:  In neural networks, if the estimated output is far away from the actual output (high error), we update the biases and weights based on the error. This weight and bias updating process is known as Back Propagation. Back-propagation (BP) algorithms work by determining the loss (or error) at the output and then propagating it back into the network. The weights are updated to minimize the error resulting from each neuron. The first step in minimizing the error is to determine the gradient (Derivatives) of each node w.r.t. the final output

- ## C
**Context**:  The condition in which something exists or happens

- ## D
**Data analysis**:  The collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making

**Data analyst**:  Someone who collects, transforms, and organizes data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making

**Data analytics**:  The science of data

**Data design**:  How information is organized

**Data ecosystem**:  The various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data

**Data science**:  A field of study that uses raw data to create new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown 

**Data strategy**:  The management of the people, processes, and tools used in data analysis

**Data visualization**:  The graphical representation of data

**Data-driven decision-making**:  Using facts to guide business strategy

**Data**:  A collection of facts

**Dataset**:  A collection of data that can be manipulated or analyzed as one unit

- ## E
- ## F
- ## G
**Gap analysis**:  A method for examining and evaluating the current state of a process in order to identify opportunities for improvement in the future

- ## H
- ## I
- ## J
- ## K
- ## L
- ## M
- ## N
- ## O
- ## P
- ## Q
- ## R
**Root cause**:  The reason why a problem occurs

- ## S
- ## T
**Technical mindset**:  The ability to break things down into smaller steps or pieces and work with them in an orderly and logical way

- ## U
- ## V
**Visualization**:  (Refer to data visualization)

- ## W
- ## X
- ## Y
- ## Z
# Contribution
If you want to contribute to this repository please follow the instructions below:
- Fork the repository.

- Run `git pull` to fetch all the recent changes otherwise your commits will clash with the main branch commits.

- Add the glossary words in their respective alphabet text file inside the dictfiles folder.

- Commit the changes as 'alphabet.txt file updated' where alphabet.txt is the file where you are going to insert words.

- Finally push the changes and the github action will update the readme file.

**NOTE:** 

- Please don't change anything inside python script if you have anything to add or to improve in the script please raise an issue first.
- Please format the glossary as 'word: meaning' because the script is going to split the word with ':'
